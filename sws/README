sws - A simple HTTP/1.0 web server
Copyright Rob Hoffmann, 2012
Once in a more complete state, I will switch this program to an open source license.

Usage:
	sws [-6dh] [-c cgidir] [-i address] [-l file] [-p port] [-s secdir -k key] rootdir

sws is a small web server created for an assignment I had in college. After the class was
completed I decided to continue work on it.

The server supports IPv4 and IPv6 connections, logging, and execution of CGI scripts. It
currently accepts HTTP/1.0 requests only, but I plan to expand functionality to allow
HTTP/1.1 requests to be received.

Todo:
	-Support for POST requests
	-Encryption (-s and -k options)
	-General refactoring
	-Add test scripts with sample requests and expected output

Options:

	-6	Listen on IPv6.

	-c cgidir
		Specifies a directory that hosts CGI files. This directory must be located
		inside the document root.

	-d	Enable debug mode. sws will listen for only one connection at a time, and
		all console output will be output to stderr rather than silenced.

	-h	Print usage information and exit.

	-i address
		Listen on the specified IP.

	-k key	
		Key to be used for encrypting content within the secure directory.
		Not yet implemented.
	
	-l logfile
		Log connection information to the specified logfile. Will not be used if
		debug mode is specified.

	-p port
		Listen on the given port.

	-s secdir
		Enable "secure" mode for this directory. All content will be encrypted 
		using the key specified with -k. Not yet implemented.
