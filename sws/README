CS631 - Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment
Final Project

Implement the sws(1) command as described in the manual page provided to you
at: http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/631/sws.1.pdf

As usual, the general homework guidelines apply:
http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/631/hw

You should accompany the program with a Makefile and, if you have any
commentary on your program, a README.  The due date for the final project is
2011-12-20, 10:59:59.

This is a non-trivial programming assignment -- do not postpone starting to
work on this!  Try to first get the basics right, then add functionality one
by one, always ensuring that the added code did not break any previous
functionality.  If you're stuck, describe your problem on the mailing list.


Considerations for this project:
--------------------------------

Please carefully read http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt to understand
version 1.0 of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

Please carefully read http://www.citycat.ru/doc/CGI/overview/overview.html
to understand version 1.1 of the Common Gateway Interface.

Your program should behave as one would expect from a regular system daemon.
That is, it should detach from the controlling terminal and run in the
background, accept multiple simultaneous connections, not generate any
messages on stdout unless in debugging mode etc.

Your program does have to return normal HTTP/1.0 status codes as described in
the RFC.

Your program does NOT need to support the POST method.

Your program does NOT need to support the "-s dir -k key" options.

Your program does NOT need to support logging.


Extra credit:
-------------

The following are ways to gain extra-credit.  Please only start working on
these features if you are satisfied with the basic functionality.

Implementing support for IPv6: +10

Implementing support for logging: +10

Implementing support for POST: +30

Implementing support for encrypted content: +50
