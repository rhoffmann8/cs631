Homework 2 & Extra Credit - tcp and tcpm

tcp and tcpm trivially copy a file using read/write or mmap/memcpy, 
respectively. Both programs perform the same string operations on parameters 
that include a directory as the destination and throw errors if either source 
or destination cannot be opened. Notice that in tcp the destination file is 
opened with O_WRONLY, whereas in tcpm it is opened with O_RDWR. This is due to 
the flag PROT_WRITE implying PROT_READ in the mmap call, so the file must 
have been opened with read/write access.

Also of note is that some garbage character must be written to the predetermined 
end of the destination file before trying to memcpy. This is to increase the 
size of the file before trying to map it into memory. Otherwise, the later 
memcpy call will result in a segmentation fault.

Both programs simulate behavior of the cp program by overwriting an existing 
file if it is specified as the destination.
